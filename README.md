<h1>Creating Organizational Units (OU's)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to establish new folders within the domain so that I can organise the domain controller section and assign new users to other folders. In this situation, I'll place new users in their appropriate department folders, making it easier to discover and manage them if they need support. In this situation, I'll establish two new folders: HR and IT. The present helpdesk account user will be moved to the IT department, while a new user named John will be putÂ in the HR department folder.</p>

<p align="center">The first step would be to go into Active Directory Users and Computers. From there, I right-click the domain name to access the options. In this scenario, I need to build a new "ORGANISATIONAL UNIT", so I navigate to the "NEW" section to access further settings.</p>

<p align="center">As you can see, I've included the names of both "ORGANISATIONAL UNITS". The first folder will be called "HR" and the second "IT". I also click the box beneath the name to ensure that the folder is protected from accidental deletion, which will keep the entire folder secure. After that, I click "OK" to create the folders.</p>
